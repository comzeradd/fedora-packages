# fedora-packages

spec files and patches for packages I maintain for the [Fedora Project](http://fedoraproject.org/). Most of these are [packaged](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/users/packages/comzeradd) to official Fedora Desktop release. Those that are not will be usually available through [Copr](http://copr.fedoraproject.org/) or [personal unofficial repos](http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/comzeradd/).
